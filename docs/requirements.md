# Requirements

For lack of a better term, this is to be the doc where certain visual, structural and language decisions are documented whence they're considered settled.

## Language used in the app

* Card - 
* Pointer - the visual representation of the type of links used on the cards
* Point - the following or preceding sentence or paragraph from a Pointer.  "Point" will not be capitalized in the app since it parallels the real dictionary meaning of "point" as "an argument or idea put forward by a person in discussion" (Google, Oxford Languages)
